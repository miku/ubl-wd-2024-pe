## About Me

[![](static/Sanco_8001.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M)

* Software Developer at [Leipzig University Library](https://ub.uni-leipzig.de)
* Open Data Engineer at [Internet Archive](https://archive.org), working on [Internet Archive Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive_Scholar)
* Misc: consultant,
  [author](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7gueY4EAAAAJ), open source
[contributor](https://github.com/miku), community
[organizer](https://golangleipzig.space/), former Lecturer at [Lancaster
University](https://www.lancasterleipzig.de/) Leipzig
* curious about computers since about 1985 ([pic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) related), curious about machine learning since about [2011](http://web.archive.org/web/20110816035332/ai-class.com)
* fun fact: published first short story at age 17, the anthology is preserved at this library, but thankfully not findable through the catalog

## Perspective on "AI"

* usually only "ML"
* I'm working and testing out [open](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04844.pdf) models, mostly - models for which the research and development process is (at least somewhat) documented

> ends in science," says Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist specializing in
> climate at HuggingFace, an open-source AI cooperative. --

* main "serious" topic, beside
  [haikus](https://golangleipzig.space/meetup-38-llm-haiku/meetup-38-llm-haiku.pdf),
is the conversion of unstructured data (e.g. "strings", "bytes") to structured data
(e.g. "metadata")

## Prompt Engineering

* the wikipedia article about [Prompt
  Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) is not that
old (first appeared in
[2021-10-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prompt_engineering&oldid=1050870205)
(a Wednesday)



## Patterns

* persona pattern, "act as X"
